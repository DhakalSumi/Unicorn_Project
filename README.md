# Unicorn Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzed Unicorn's sales data to uncover insights for business growth. We examined trends in customer behavior, product performance, and regional profitability using Google Sheets, SQL, and Tableau for analysis.

## Approach to Data
### Data Cleaning:
Extensive cleaning was performed to ensure data accuracy, including adjustments to the Profit Rate based on formulas and assumptions.

### Assumptions:
We assumed that Profit, Sales, Quantity, Discount, and other variables were clearly defined.

## Problem Statement
**High Customer Count but Low Profitability:**
Cities like Houston, Philadelphia, Dallas, and Chicago, despite having more than 77 customers, still operate at a loss. Meanwhile, New York shows the highest profitability. There is a significant gap in profit per customer, ranging from New York's ($62.019) to Philadelphia's (-$13.832).

## Key Insights
1. **Seasonal Sales, Low Profit Growth:**
   - December experiences a sales spike ($35.568), but profit does not grow proportionally.
   - High discounts (>29%) and lower-margin products contribute to lower profitability.

2. **Discounts Affect Profitability:**
   - Discounts above 30% negatively impact profitability, particularly in the Furniture and Office Supplies categories.
   - Despite a modest 0.3% discount on Tables and Binders, profits remain negative.

3. **Delivery Impact on Profit:**
   - Longer delivery times in states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Florida negatively affect profitability.
   - Shipping delays beyond five days for Tables increase costs and reduce customer satisfaction.

4. **Manufacturer Performance:**
   - Products sold by nearly all manufacturers in selected subcategories are unprofitable.
   - This issue may be related to pricing, production costs, or product quality.

## Recommendations
1. **Focus on Profitability of Cities:**
   - Unicorn should rethink its approach to loss-making cities with high customer counts (Houston, Philadelphia, Dallas, and Chicago).
   - Conduct market segmentation to tailor strategies and boost profitability.

2. **Optimize Product and Delivery Strategy:**
   - Improve delivery times in targeted regions.
   - Expand product offerings in the underperforming Furniture category to capture more market share.

3. **Enhance Seasonal Strategy:**
   - Maximize Q4 sales through promotions while analyzing why increased revenue does not translate into higher profits.

4. **Refine Discount Policy:**
   - Limit discounts to 30% or less for the most sensitive categories.
   - Implement tiered discounts for lower-demand products.

5. **Establish a Quality-Based Supplier Optimization Program:**
   - Focus on improving product profitability through better supplier management.

## Conclusion
Unicorn should prioritize regional expansion, optimize product and discount strategies, and improve delivery efficiency. By addressing issues such as shipping delays, excessive discounts, and operational inefficiencies, profitability and customer satisfaction can be significantly enhanced.
